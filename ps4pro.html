  <p class="ps4text"> The PS4 Pro is Sony's latest console in the 8th generation of consoles. It allows the PS4 to display 4k resolution (on 4k TVs). However this display is not native in all games. A lot of games are just upscaled from 1080p and it's not really '4k' and when it is actually 4k there are frequent frame drops. Furthermore not all games will support the PS4 Pro, which means some of your favorite games may not be able to display 4k even if the hardware is there. Developers have to actually re-code their game to support it. As always you would be better off buying a PC.
