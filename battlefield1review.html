<h2>Battlefield 1 (Reviewed on PC by Ethan Jones, played for 55 hours)</h2>

<p id="bf1text"> Battlefield 1 is DICE's latest entry in the super popular Battlefield series. Unlike some of the previous entries such as Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, Battlefield 1 is set in World War 1.

The setting change is refreshing, and extremley well exectued. When I first heard that the next Battlefield would be going to World War 1, I was a bit nervous that it would not turn out so great. I was completley wrong and the setting change is one of the best features ever added to any Battlefield. 

When it comes to Graphics Battlefield 1 is stunning, the graphics are amazing, and the map detail is superb. Unfortunetly there are more then a few graphical glitches, the main one being a glitch that ocurs to some PC users, such as myslef, where the sun on the map Aimens expands to cover half of the map.

Battlefield 1 offers 6 modes: Conquest, Domination, Operations, Rush, War Pigeons, and Team Deathmatch. All of these are unique, and play well. My favorite mode so far is Operations, a new mode to the series. Operations provide a mode that feels like real war. It is a attack and defend game mode. The attackers have a certain number of lives and have to rush the defenders to take different sections of the map. Each Operation is in a playlist of two maps that correspond in story, so after one map is cleared by the attackers the defenders get another chance to defend and win on the next map.<br>

Battlefied 1 has a 7 - 10 hour campaign that although short is very engaging and intertaining. It is told in little war stories, there are 6 of them and they can each be completed in 1 and a half to 2 hours each.<br>

Overall besides it's glitches Battlefield 1 is almost the perfect shooter and the best I have seen in years.<br>
